# Parenthesis Checker

This repository contains an implementation of a Parenthesis Checker in Java. The Parenthesis Checker algorithm is used to validate the correctness of the arrangement of parenthesis characters in a given string.

## Features
- **Java Implementation**: The algorithm is implemented in Java, making it platform-independent and easily accessible.
- **Efficient Validation**: The implementation efficiently checks the correctness of parenthesis arrangements in a string.
- **Educational Resource**: This repository serves as a practical example for understanding string manipulation algorithms in Java.

## How to Use
To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.

3. Compile the Java files using the Java compiler. For example:
   ```
   javac ParenthesisChecker.java
   ```

4. Run the compiled Java program, passing the string containing parentheses to be checked as an argument. For example:
   ```
   java ParenthesisChecker "(a+b)-(c+d)"
   ```

## Example
For example, if you run the program with the string "(a+b)-(c+d)", you should see the output:
   ```
   Parentheses are balanced.
   ```
